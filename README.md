# hello-world
My First Repository!
Well I have never used Github before and figured this was a good place to start to wrap my brain around it.

So far Github makes logical sense and is pretty sweet. It feels super powerful and I can tell I'm barely scratching the surface. 

I look forward to understanding it more!
